	"Description"	"Horror for me, horror for you, let's try and survive through Horror For Two! In this mutation, you only have 2 survivors. Along with this, almost ALL guns are removed. In fact, the only three guns you can find are the pump/chrome shotgun, the magnum, and the grenade launcher. Dual pistols, too, if you pick up the pistol your teammate drops grabbing a magnum. Oh, also, the shotguns and grenade launcher have highly lowered reserve ammos. All throwables and health items still appear, however. Now, to balance this somewhat, there is a lowered amount of Common Infected, and there can only be 1 Special Infected spawned at a time. Also, every time someone spawns they are given a pump shotgun. Don't let the decrease in infected get you down, though, the tension in this mutation is guaranteed to snap your neck!"
