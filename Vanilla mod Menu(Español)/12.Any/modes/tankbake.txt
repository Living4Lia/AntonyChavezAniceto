	"ShortDescription"	"It's Baking time!"
	"Description"	"No Common Infected spawn, only Tanks. One Tank spawns every 10 seconds, with a max of 8 Tanks. You only have a Magnum and one molotov on you, but you'll find a lot more mollies along the way. You'll have to use molotov's to bake the Tanks. They will die quicker when on fire, this is your only defense against the Tanks."
