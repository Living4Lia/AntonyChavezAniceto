	"Description"	"Only one player is randomly chosen to be the 'Big Daddy', the Super Charger who can't run or melee worth a lick, but if he gets a hold of you, you're as good as dead unless your team is willing to sacrifice themselves to save you. Teamed up with the Big Daddy are 3 little 'Spitsters'. p*ssed off females who lost the potency of their venom and neglected their overall health. To counter, they grew a set of huge claws and insane speed."
