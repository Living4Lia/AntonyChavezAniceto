	"Description"	"Much like 'Last Man on Earth' with two people. No common infected spawn, only specials. If pinned and incapped, you self-help yourself up and go black and white. Get incapped a second time, you die. Since there's two players instead of the usual one, another alteration is made: no health kits. Instead, there's plenty of defibs to go around..."
